## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Kept Claude and ChatGPT subscription models on This Mac's local runtime when the Agents Window target is This Mac (Remote Control), instead of sending those IDs through Cursor's cloud create RPC. Cloud and Remote Machine targets are unchanged.
- Added Cursor 3.21.13 support on Apple Silicon with captured original Mac hashes and updated model-picker, routing, usage-card and subagent symbols.
- Updated native validation to follow the current Responses adapter symbols and the task factory's `availableModels` contract.
- Kept Claude MAX and Explore helpers separate from GPT helpers so a combined installation produces valid workbench and runtime modules while preserving both providers.
- Routed subscription turns through Cursor's existing local execution strategy when Agent Host is enabled, covering new turns, resume and summarization without changing ordinary-model routing.
- Registered the native execution provider through Agent Host's existing shared runtime, preserving host options and cleanup ownership; subscription turns now report a compatibility error in temporarily unsupported independent Agent Host modes.
- Combined GPT-first install now records `claudeManifest` on the linked GPT manifest, uses a Claude-specific task-props native wrapper so GPT's wrapper stays callable, and skips the 0444 permission assertion when tests run as root.
- `selectedModelIds` now keeps only Explore IDs that start with this provider prefix, so a foreign selection is not added to the Claude catalog.
- Serialized Explore and Task-bubble helpers no longer close over Node imports (`requireSubscriptionPrefix`, `CLAUDE_PREFIX`). Patchers still validate the prefix; bubbles emit `CLAUDE_PREFIX` into the workbench bundle.
- `--restore` reads the existing `installed.json` first and no longer requires `getBuild()` to succeed, so a leftover 3.20.17 patch can be uninstalled after this checkout moved to a newer supported build.
- Tested the combined-install GPT overlay separately and through the verified Mac build preflight.
- Skipped linked GPT restore when that checkout's `installed.json` is gone, even if the parent directory still exists. Do not recreate an archived GPT manifest.
- `check:actions` now asserts the same derived runtime insertions the 3.21 patcher writes, instead of pinning `_` / `e,r,s`.
- Privatized Cursor.app to `0700` on every version installer before writing the bridge key into workbench assets, matching 3.20.17. Rollback restores recorded `appMode`.
- Made version `--restore` retryable after a partial copy by accepting already-restored `originalHash` targets, and restored linked GPT manifests from saved `linked.original` without aborting if that checkout is gone. `install.mjs` still archives `installed.json` after re-sign. Linked GPT writes ignore only `ENOENT`; other filesystem errors still abort. Every version installer records `appMode` from `requireWritableApp`.
- Advertised Cursor MAX-switch metadata only on versions that install `patchMaxMode`; 3.20.17 still exposes the Context dropdown and 200K/1M display split.
- Wired `verifySubagentSettings` into `check:subagents` and failed closed on unknown `lifecycleSymbols` versions.
- Left `installed.json` in place during version `--restore` so the macOS wrapper can re-sign Cursor, and hash-checked companion GPT manifests only on overlapping paths.
- Kept top-level `context_window` on `/v1/models` next to `capabilities.context_length` for Cursor 3.20.17 clients.
- Enabled installation in Cursor 3.20.17 on macOS Apple Silicon with verified Mac hashes and Apple code signing that preserves hardened runtime and entitlements.
- Kept restoration retryable through signing failures and preserved a companion ChatGPT installation when removing Claude.
- Preserved the active restoration manifest when a combined installation is installed again.
- Checked the installed executable for Apple Silicon support and restored recorded app permissions after standalone removal.
- Corrected companion discovery, Rosetta detection, exact bridge restart matching and private startup diagnostics.
- Routed Cursor tool requests through distinct transport names so Claude does not confuse them with its disabled built-in tools.

### Changed

- Target only Cursor 3.21.13 with verified Mac metadata and one install/restore/write pipeline and symbol-table row.
- Restricted installation to the verified macOS build; unknown versions, commits and file hashes remain rejected.
- Patched the selected app directly, without requiring a full-app backup.
- Synced upstream Explore settings, context/MAX, subagent lifecycle and queued follow-up patches, then ported their symbols to the verified Mac build.
